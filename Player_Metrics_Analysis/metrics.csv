6.0,"In this image, we see two of the greatest tennis players of all time, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, locked in an intense battle at the French Open. Djokovic currently holds a 40-30 advantage in the game, indicating that he is one point away from taking the game.

Both players are in excellent positions to hit the ball, with Nadal on the right side of the court and Djokovic on the left. Nadal has a slightly open stance, with his left foot slightly in front of his right. This stance allows him to generate more power on his forehand, which is his dominant shot. Djokovic, on the other hand, has a more closed stance, with his feet almost parallel to each other. This stance gives him more stability and allows him to cover more of the court.

Both players have their knees bent and their bodies low, which allows them to generate more power and control on their shots. They are also both leaning slightly forward, which helps them to stay balanced and to be ready to react to any shot that their opponent hits.

In terms of shot selection, Nadal is likely to hit a forehand to Djokovic's backhand. This is a shot that Nadal has a lot of success with, as it allows him to hit the ball with topspin and to keep it low to the ground. Djokovic, on the other hand, is likely to hit a backhand to Nadal's forehand. This is a shot that Djokovic has a lot of control over, and it will allow him to keep the ball in play and to wait for an opportunity to hit a winner.
